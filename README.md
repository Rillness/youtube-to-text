# youtube-to-text
Application that converts youtube videos to text asynchronously via a stream. The code is free and you can use it anywhere.
I made this in 11th grade. I was failing high school, due to watching videos on web / ios development while in class. I thought this might help combat the habit. It really didn't. Btw I did graduate, just not with a good gpa ;) 

## 1) To use this, you need API keys from IBM's Watson Bluemix, and an API key from Cloudconvert.com. 
## 2) Follow the directions in the code, and you should be able to convert any youtube video, into text.
